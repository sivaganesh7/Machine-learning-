## Solve these problems:

1. **Array of Consecutive Numbers**:
   - Create a one-dimensional NumPy array containing the first ten whole numbers. Use this array for subsequent exercises to practice basic array operations.

2. **Squares of Numbers**:
   - Given a one-dimensional array of integers, write a NumPy code that calculates the square of each element. This exercise helps understand element-wise operations in arrays.

3. **Dimension Transformation**:
   - Take a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 and reshape it into a two-dimensional array with 2 rows and 5 columns. Explore how reshaping changes the structure of data, which is crucial in data preprocessing.

4. **Slice of Life**:
   - Extract a slice from the third to the fifth elements inclusive from a given one-dimensional array. Discuss how slicing can be used to subset data, a common task in data analysis.

5. **Conditional Mastery**:
   - Write a NumPy program to select all elements from an array that are greater than 5. This task illustrates how to use conditional statements for data filtering.

6. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of an array's elements. This introduces the basic statistical functions in NumPy, essential for any data analysis.

7. **Matrix Product**:
   - Perform a matrix multiplication between two 2x2 matrices. Explore how matrix operations are performed in NumPy, which is fundamental for algorithms involving linear transformations and neural networks.

8. **Odd One Out**:
   - Use boolean indexing to replace all odd numbers in an array with -1. This problem helps understand boolean masking, a powerful feature for modifying arrays based on conditions.

9. **Random Number Generation**:
   - Create a 3x3 matrix with random numbers drawn from a normal distribution. Investigate the properties of random distributions and their applications.

10. **Join the Arrays**:
    - Learn how to concatenate two 1D arrays both vertically and horizontally. This operation is critical in combining data from different sources.

11. **Common Ground**:
    - Find the intersection of two one-dimensional arrays. This exercise is useful in data comparison tasks, such as finding common elements in data sets.

12. **Data Ingestion**:
    - Load a dataset from a CSV file into a NumPy array and extract just the first column. This demonstrates how NumPy can be used for initial data handling before in-depth analysis.

13. **Complex Numbers Handling**:
    - Create and sort a one-dimensional array of complex numbers based on their real part. This will help understand how NumPy handles complex number data types.

14. **Equation Solver**:
    - Solve a set of linear equations using NumPy's linear algebra module. This illustrates the practical application of NumPy in solving mathematical problems.
